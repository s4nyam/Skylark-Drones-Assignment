CSV_Dataset to GEOJSON conversion using online tools. it can also be done using scripts either.

Then I plotted GeoJSON on GeoJSON.io

Also, It benefited me to use the same geojson file in mapbox web studio.

Then after uploading geojson to mapbox dataset then tilesets and then studio, I edited the map. (In dataset section)
